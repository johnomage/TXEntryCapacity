plant_type_description = "CCGT (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine) plants, including various configurations, account for a total of approximately 36.93GW connected primarily to NGET. \
                         Energy Storage Systems dominate with an impressive total of 134.54GW, showcasing their critical role in stabilizing the grid and integrating renewable \
                         energy sources.  Wind Offshore plants show a substantial capacity of 127.28GW, indicating their pivotal role in the current energy mix. They are \
                         well-represented across all connections, especially NGET and SHET. Wind Onshore contributes a capacity of 28.95 GW, reinforcing the importance of both \
                         offshore and onshore wind in the renewable sector. Conventional sources like Coal, Oil & AGT, and Gas Reciprocating show relatively low contributions (e.g., 2.05GW, 61.5 MW, and 661.78 MW respectively).\
                         This trend reflects a broader shift towards cleaner energy sources. Nuclear Power provides a significant capacity of 19.09 GW, still an essential \
                         component of the low-carbon energy landscape."
