## Introduction

The Transmission Entry Capacity (TEC) Register is a record of generation projects that hold contracts for Transmission Entry Capacity (TEC) with National Grid ESO. This includes both connected projects and future connection projects, as well as projects that are directly connected to the National Electricity Transmission System (NETS) or connected at distribution level (and which have a Bilateral Embedded Generator Agreement (BEGA)). TEC is the maximum capacity in MW that a generator is permitted to export into the NETS. It is one of the two types of connection capacity included in transmission offers. The other is Connection Entry Capacity (CEC), which is the maximum potential output of a generation asset onto the NETS. CEC is often set higher than TEC to allow for changes over years in outputs without needing to adapt or modify infrastructure.

| Stage                                   | number | Stage refers to Staged TEC â€“ how much TEC the Customer will connect and when. The customer may choose to bring on capacity in chunks to align with their build/commissioning program. Staged contracts are also used when a customer may only be able to bring on a proportion of their total capacity at a particular point in time ahead of further reinforcement works being carried out, completion of which would allow the remaining TEC onto the system. |                                                                      | 1                                |        |
